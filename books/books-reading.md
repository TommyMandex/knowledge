## Currently Reading

A list of books that I am currently reading.

- Caliban's War (The Expanse: #2), by James S.A. Corey
- The Holy Bible: Holman Christian Standard
- Learning Python 5th Ed., by Mark Lutz
- The Long War, Terry Pratchett
- The Martian, by Andy Weir
- Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History. Notes: 450 pages of pure, geeky awesomeness. Reading this brings back so many good memories from the early 80s. #dnd #rpg
