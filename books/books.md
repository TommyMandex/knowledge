## Books

I learned early on the joys of reading a good book. I particularly enjoy reading new books, writing down any observations that I might have, and sharing those notes with the world.

## Tracking

I like to keep track of the books that I have read and the books that I plan on reading. To that end I use a combination of [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/pmullins) and personal notes.

## Book Lists

Below are links to books that I have read or have started reading. The books with links attached will lead to Amazon and/or notes that I made when reading the book. 

- [Books that I am currently reading](books-reading.md)
- [Books that I have read](books-read.md)

Note: Books with a star (⭐️) are my favorite.
