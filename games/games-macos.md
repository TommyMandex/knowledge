## macOS

I know what you're thinking, but gaming on macOS *is* getting better these days. The platform might not have access to
Microsoft's DirectX graphics runtime but it does have Apple's [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) graphics API 
and the later is slowly proving itself more than capable of providing game developers everything needed to create games 
and/or port them.
