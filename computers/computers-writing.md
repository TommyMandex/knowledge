## Writing

I use a variety of applications when it comes to writing. Sure, I could simply use the same editor that I use to write code with to write prose. In fact, I know plenty of people who do just that. However, I'm not one of them. When I'm writing I like to have applications that are tailored towards the writing process.  

These days, more often than not, my the beginning of my writing process begins inside TextEdit. Yes, you read that correctly, Apple's little text editor that could. I find it super easy to call up a TextEdit window with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) and then start jotting down notes. Another application that has found its way into my daily routine is [MWeb](https://www.mweb.im). MWeb is a pro Markdown writing, note taking and static blog generator app.

When it comes time to sit down and hash out something longer like a chapter or an article I will use something like [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) or [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com).
