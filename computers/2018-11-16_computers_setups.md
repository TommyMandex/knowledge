## Mobile Setup

My mobile setup is comprised of a 2018 15" MacBook Pro (2.6 GHz Hexa Core Intel Core i7. 16 GB 2400 MHz DDR4. 500GB SSD. 4GB Radeon Pro 560X), Apple Magic Mouse, iPhone XSM, and a 1st generation 12.9" iPad Pro. 

## Desktop

My desktop setup is a wee bit more complicated than my mobile setup. In my home office I have a huge Ikea Gallant desk with two 27" monitors. The first is a 27" BenQ [BL2711U](https://amzn.to/2Fp6XbL) 4K (3840x2160) ultrahigh definition (UHD) monitor connected to a 13 Port OWC Thunderbolt 3 [dock](https://amzn.to/2TidHer), an Apple Magic Mouse and an older Apple wireless keyboard. The second is a 144 Hz 27" BenQ [XL2720Z](https://amzn.to/2RTIooM) 1080P gaming monitor that's hooked up to a Sony PlayStation 4 and a Hewlett-Packard docking station.
