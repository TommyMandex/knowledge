## Development

I prefer BASH for scripting and quick prototyping but will use [Python](http://www.python.org/) if need be. I like to tinker with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Swift](https://swift.org/) for system and server things, and I occasionally dabble in the arcane arts known as [Lisp](http://www.newlisp.org/) programming. Web development is done via PHP and [PHPixie](https://phpixie.com/) on local virtual machines managed by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and VMware Fusion or Canonical's [Multipass](https://multipass.run/). Source code is stored in Git and managed with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), and sometimes [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) (an open source self-hosted Git server). For containerization I use the full Mac [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac) stack (Docker Engine, Docker Machine, Docker Hub, Kitematic). My favorite orchestration tool at the moment is [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com).
