## Quantum Computing

Microsoft defines Quantum Computing as computing that applies the properties of quantum physics to process information. Operating with nanoscale components at temperatures colder than intergalactic space, quantum computing has the potential to solve some of the world’s toughest challenges. Taking only days or hours to solve problems that would take billions of years using today’s computers, quantum computers will enable new discoveries in the areas of healthcare, energy, environmental systems, smart materials, and beyond.
