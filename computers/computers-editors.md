## Text/Source Code Editors

My current text editor of choice is BBEdit, a modern text editor that supports things like debugging, Git management, syntax highlighting, and code snippets. For those interested, I've configured it to use the [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) font and the Solarized Light theme. In addition to BBEdit I have recently been toying around with Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), GitHub's [Atom](https://atom.io), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), and [Oni](https://www.onivim.io/).
