## Retro Gaming

This is the other thing that I've been working on recently. Retro Gaming! Yeah, I still love all these old games. Sure, the newer games are great, but there's just something special about the games from 1980-1995. I use [OpenEmu]() to run Atari 2600, Nintendo (NES), Super Nintendo (SNES), MAME, and Nintendo 64 (N64) games and a Raspberry Pi and Amibian to run Amiga games. 
When I want to create a new Doom level I use [Slade]() and when I want to play a round of Doom I use [GZDoom]().

## 8Bitdo SF30 Pro 

Finally, to tie all this stuff together, I bought and am using an 8Bitdo SN30 Pro/SF30 Pro gaming controller. This is the worlds first, fully featured retro controller. It boasts a full button set with clickable joysticks, rumble vibration, motion controls, wireless bluetooth, rechargeable battery, home and screen shot buttons, a USB-C connector, and a proper d-pad. This bad boy has been designed to be as versatile as possible. It easily pairs as an X-input or D-input device via bluetooth. I can even use it as a wired USB controller. It works with Windows, MacOS, the Raspberry Pi, the Nintendo Switch, Steam, Android, and iOS. In my case I primarily use it to control old Atari 2600, SNES, and Amiga games. However, I did connect it to my Nintendo Switch today and played a round of Diablo III. Overall, I'm extremely happy with this little controller.
