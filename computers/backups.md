# Backups

I'm currently using [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html) to backup my MacBook Pro and my wife's MacBook Air. Backblaze offers unlimited cloud backups for $5.00 a month. Not bad considering how much everyone else charges for cloud storage. Another option that I'm seriously considering is using [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) to make encrypted backups of all of our data and storing it on a  datastore service like Backblaze's [B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html), Amazon's [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), or Google's Cloud [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview) service.

## Notes

- Data that is not backed up is lost data.
- Even the smallest file can take days to recreate.
- Do not backup to standard DVD/Blu-Ray discs. Fluctuations in temperature can cause the dye layer (which holds your data) to dissolve.
- 54% of people said they either know someone, or have themselves recently lost data.
- Most users do not take advantage of even basic security practices, such as encryption, backup and anti-theft technologies.
- A 3-2-1 strategy means having at least 3 total copies of your data, 2 of which are local but on different mediums (read: devices), and at least 1 copy offsite.
