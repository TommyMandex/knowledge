## Email 

Having multiple email addresses seems to be the norm these days. We all started out with our ISP provided email and then graduated on to Google's [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) or maybe Apple's [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/). I'm no exception to the rule. Up until recently I used both iCloud and Gmail. I even went so far as storing all of my mail on their servers. In hindsight, using free email services probably wasn't the best of ideas when it comes to privacy. 

## Current Provider

I'm happy to say that I've realized the folly of my ways and have converted over to using [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com) as my full-time email provider.
