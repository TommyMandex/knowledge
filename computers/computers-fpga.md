## Field-Programmable Gate Array

I just found a decently priced FPGA-based computer system on eBay. An FPGA is basically the pinnacle of hardware emulation. You can essentially use one to emulate just about any hardware that you can think of. In this case I could use it to emulate an Amiga 500/1200, an Atari 2600, a Nintendo SNES, and more. All you have to do is load the proper software into the FPGA and it suddenly transforms into whatever computer you're trying to emulate. Oh, and did I mention that this emulation is full speed? It's as if you actually had a beefed up A1200 sitting in front of you.
