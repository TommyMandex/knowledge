## Primary Computer

My primary computer is a 2018 15" MacBook Pro with the following specs: a 2.6GHz 6 core Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of 2400MHz DDR4 RAM, a 500GB Apple SSD, and a Radeon Pro 560X GPU with 4GB of RAM. Of course this wouldn't be complete without my [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-anywhere-2s-flow) MX Anywhere 2S mouse. I've been giving some serious thought to selling this particular laptop and buying a new 16" MacBook Pro or a 13" MacBook Air with Retina Display. In the case of the later I would be sacrificing two inches of screen real estate, a more powerful CPU, and the TouchBar. However, I would be be gaining a better keyboard, a top row with physical keys, a T2 Security Chip, and a laptop that weighs half as much.

## Desktop Computer(s)

My desktop setup is a wee bit more complicated than my mobile setup. In my home office I have a huge L-shaped Ikea Gallant desk with two large monitors. The first is a 27" BenQ [BL2711U](https://amzn.to/2Fp6XbL) 4K (3840x2160) ultrahigh definition (UHD) monitor connected to a 13 Port [OWC ](https://amzn.to/2TidHer) Thunderbolt 3 dock, an Apple Magic Mouse, an older Apple wireless keyboard, and a 2011 Mac Mini w/16GB of RAM. The second is a BenQ [XL2720Z](https://amzn.to/2RTIooM) which is a 144Hz 27" 1080P gaming monitor that's hooked up to a Sony PlayStation 4, a Raspberry Pi 3, and a vintage Amiga 500 that has been upgraded with a [Vampire](https://wiki.apollo-accelerators.com/doku.php/vampire:v500-v2plus:start) 500 V2+ accelerator. 

## Mobile Devices

I just picked up a new Apple [iPhone Xs Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/specs/) with an [A12 Bionic](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/a12-bionic/) CPU, and a [Series 4](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/) Watch to go along with my 2015 12.9" iPad Pro and my Series 4 Apple Watch.

## Networking

My home network is made up of several Cisco gigabit switches, an [EdgeRouter X](https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/), and two Synology [MR2200AC](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/MR2200ac) mesh routers with tri-band 2.13 Gbps (400+867+867 Mbps) antennas and a dedicated 5GHz backhaul channel for router communication. Each router has a single 4 core 750 MHZ ARM CPU, 256MB of RAM, and a USB 3.1 port. That's not too shabby for a router. Anyway, I highly recommend Synology when it comes to networking equipment.

## Home Lab

My home lab contains a [QNAP 563](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/model.php?II=194&event=2) NAS, Lenovo TS140 ThinkServer, an old Dell PowerEdge T100 server, and a six node [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computing cluster. I'm currently using the ThinkServer and PowerEdge (which are running VMWare ESXi) to host multiple Linux and Windows virtual machines.
