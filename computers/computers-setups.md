## Primary Computer

My primary computer is a 2018 15" MacBook Pro with the following specs: a single 2.6GHz Hexa Core Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of 2400MHz DDR4 RAM, a single 500GB SSD, and a Radeon Pro 560X GPU with 4GB of RAM. Of course this wouldn't be complete without an Apple [Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLA02LL/A/magic-mouse-2-silver). This isn't the fastest thing that Apple produces but it works just fine for me and what I do. In fact, I've been giving some serious thought to selling this laptop and buying the new Apple [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) with Retina display. I would be sacrificing 2" of screen real estate, a more powerful CPU, and the TouchBar. However, I would be be gaining a better keyboard, a top row with physical keys, a T2 Security Chip, and a laptop that weighs 1/2 as much.

## Mobile Devices

I just picked up a new Apple [iPhone Xs Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/specs/) with an [A12 Bionic](https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/a12-bionic/) CPU, and a [Series 4](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-4/) Watch to go along with my 2015 12.9" iPad Pro.

## Desktop

My desktop setup is a wee bit more complicated than my mobile setup. In my home office I have a huge Ikea Gallant desk with two 27" monitors. The first is a 27" BenQ [BL2711U](https://amzn.to/2Fp6XbL) 4K (3840x2160) ultrahigh definition (UHD) monitor connected to a 13 Port [OWC Thunderbolt](https://amzn.to/2TidHer) 3 dock, an Apple Magic Mouse, and an older Apple wireless keyboard. The second is a BenQ [XL2720Z](https://amzn.to/2RTIooM) which is a  144Hz 27" 1080P gaming monitor that's hooked up to a Sony PlayStation 4 and a Hewlett-Packard docking station. 

## Network

My home network is made up of several Cisco gigabit switches, a beefy [EdgeRouter X](https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/) router, several Eero mesh-points, and a single Eero 5Ghz router. So far we haven't had any issues switching over to mesh networking. 

## Home Lab

My home lab contains a [QNAP 563](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/model.php?II=194&event=2) NAS, Lenovo TS140 ThinkServer, Dell PowerEdge T100, an old 2011 Apple Mac Mini server, and a six node [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computing cluster. I'm currently using the ThinkServer and PowerEdge (which are running VMWare ESXi) to host multiple Linux and Windows virtual machines.
