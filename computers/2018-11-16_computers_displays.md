## Super Retina Display

My 2018 15" MacBook Pro has a native resolution of 2880x1800 and displays 220 pixels per inch. Which is great if you want tons of space. However, if you're older like me, you'll probably want to scale it down a bit. What most folks don't know is that if you scale down the resolution to 1440x900 you'll get a super retina display that pushes 440 pixels per inch. Sure, you lose all that extra space, but you gain twice the pixel depth and that means a sharper, more detailed display overall. 

## External Monitors

Most folks will dock their laptop when used at a desk in combination with an external monitor. What most folks don't know is that just because you're using an external monitor doesn't mean you have to give up that super sharp retina display that you love so much. You can replicate that high DPI screen by choosing an external 4K monitor that has a native resolution of 3840x2160 and then scaling down your display to 1920x1080.
