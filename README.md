## Introduction
Personal Knowledge-Base

Welcome to the personal wiki of Patrick H. Mullins. This is the place where I share [everything I know](https://pmullins.gitbook.io/personal-wiki) about this world in the form of an online GitBook. Feel free to hang out and browse the pages. You never know what you might find. :-)
