## Coding - The Ruby Programming Language

What exactly is Ruby? Ruby is an open-source, dynamic programming language (created in 1995 by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto) that focuses on simplicity and productivity. It accomplishes this lofty goal via an elegant, sugar-coated syntax that is super easy to read and write. 

What can you do with Ruby? Ruby might seem simple but it can be used to create everything from system scripts to full web application backends and everything in between. How do I get started learning Ruby? Thankfully, Ruby comes pre-loaded on just about every modern operating system on Earth. Odds are pretty good that you already have Ruby installed on your computer. However, if this isn't the case (Windows much?), you can easily download and install Ruby from the [Ruby on Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/) homepage. 

Now what? That's an easy one. Check out a few of the links below to get started learning Ruby! Are you a visual learner? Check out the Code Academy and/or Treehouse online courses. Like video games? Check out Ruby Warrior and Ruby Code Wars. Maybe you're better with books? Check out the free, online book Introduction to Programming with Ruby. Please feel free to email and/or ping me with any questions that you might have. Welcome to the wonderful world of Ruby programming! :-)
