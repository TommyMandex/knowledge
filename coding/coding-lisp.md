## Coding - Lisp

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer)) once said "part of what makes Lisp distinctive is that it is designed to evolve. As new abstractions become popular (object-oriented programming, for example), it always turns out to be easy to implement them in Lisp. Like DNA, such a language does not go out of style." Lisp is a general purpose programming language designed by John McCarthy in 1958. Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today.
