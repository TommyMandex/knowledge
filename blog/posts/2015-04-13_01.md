## The Ultimate Hard Drive

I'm sending this out as a kind of public service announcement for those of you looking to upgrade the hard drive in your desktop, laptop, game console, etc. You might even be looking for an external backup drive or a set of drives for your business or home server. I'm not going to tell you that my favorite brand is the best and that every other manufacturer sucks eggs. On the contrary, every manufacturer has their ups and downs when it comes to producing hard drives. However, one in particular has a better track record than others. [HGST](http://www.hgst.com/) (Hitachi Global Storage Technologies) is that company. 

During the early years of personal computing [IBM](http://www.ibm.com) made the best hard drives you could buy. They cost more than average but they were built like [Sherman](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540138/Sherman-tank) tanks and proved themselves over the years to be extremely reliable. Eventually, IBM decided that they'd rather not be a hard drive manufacturer any longer and sold the drive division and all of its technology to [Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi). Hitachi took over and quickly learned that the technology was so good that they didn't have to do anything other then build what IBM had already designed. They even stuck with IBM's naming conventions and model numbers. Hitachi built these drives for several decades before eventually selling the entire division lock, stock, and barrel to [Western Digital](http://www.wdc.com/en/). At the time of the sale Western Digital's reputation for building quality drives was extreme low and the sale was heralded as the final end of IBM's fabled tech. However, Western Digital, like Hitachi before it, discovered that the overall technology had not really changed that much and was just as good as ever. They eventually decided to run HGST as a whole-owned subsidiary and left it as is. 

The HGST hard drive that you buy today is essentially the same drive engineered by IBM all those years ago and has been proven to still be the highest quality hard drive that money can buy. They still cost a little more than the other guys, but that extra money is buying long-standing, proven technology and is helping carry on the legend created by IBM. I use HGST drives for everything from my home server to the internal drive in my [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/ps4/) 4 and the external USB drive that I backup my laptop with. I highly recommend you give them a second thought the next time you're in the market for a new hard dive.
