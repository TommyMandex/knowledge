## Scripts

Here you'll find all the scripts that I have written for MacOS. These are nothing more than small utilities that adhere to the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). Feel free to download, use, and modify. 

## Legal 

All scripts are presented as-is. By downloading you are acknowledging that I am not responsible for any damage to your system might that might arise from the use of said scripts. Sorry for the legalize, but I gotta cover my butt ya know.
