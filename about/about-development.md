## Development

I blog using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a super-fast system built with Go. I prefer [Python](http://www.python.org/) for scripting and quick prototyping, I like to tinker with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Swift](https://swift.org/) for system and server things, and I occasionally dabble in the arcane arts known as [Lisp](http://www.newlisp.org/) programming. Web development is done via PHP 7.0 and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) on local virtual machines managed by [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and VMware Fusion. I write Swift (MacOS and iOS) code locally using Xcode and then push it to a local Mac Mini server for compilation. Code is stored in Git and managed with [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), and sometimes [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) (an open source self-hosted Git server). For containerization I use the full Mac [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac) stack (Docker Engine, Docker Machine, Docker Hub, Kitematic) and I've been messing around with [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) and [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt). My favorite orchestration tool at the moment is [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com).
