## About - Composing

I use a variety of hardware and software synthesizers to compose with. My primary hardware synthesizer is a [Roland SE-02](https://amzn.to/2OHYbFw) that can do just about anything that I throw at it. Other, smaller synthesizers like the [Korg Volca FM](https://amzn.to/2PiATrd), [Korg Volca Keys](https://amzn.to/2L0gZxM), [Korg kaossilator 2S](https://amzn.to/2MvcmAr), and a [Teenage Engineering PO-35](https://amzn.to/2waC6YB) round out my hardware instruments. On the software side, I prefer to work with the [Korg iDS-10](https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_ids_10/), [Moog Animoog](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/animoog-0), [Moog Model D](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/minimoog-model-d-app), and the [Moog Filtatron](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/filtatron). I have a variety of MIDI controllers that I like to use to either control hardware or software synths. My current favorite is the [Arturia KeyStep](https://amzn.to/2vPbywQ). The [Novation LaunchPad Mini](https://amzn.to/2Pi1pAJ) is good for creating more complex pieces, and I would never let go of my [ROLI Live Block](https://amzn.to/2vSeLM1), [ROLI LightPad M](https://amzn.to/2PgRVG0), and [ROLI Seaboard Block](https://amzn.to/2PgS1NS). Finally, all of this is connected to a [Mackie Mix8](https://amzn.to/2MRBVsA) mixer and recordings are done via a [Roland R-07](https://amzn.to/2wa2eTy) portable studio recorder.
