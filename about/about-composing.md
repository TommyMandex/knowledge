## Composing

I use a variety of hardware and software synthesizers to compose with. My primary hardware synthesizer is a [Roland SE-02](https://amzn.to/2OHYbFw) that can do just about anything that I throw at it. Other, smaller synthesizers like the [Korg Volca FM](https://amzn.to/2PiATrd), [Korg Volca Keys](https://amzn.to/2L0gZxM), [Korg kaossilator 2S](https://amzn.to/2MvcmAr), and a [Teenage Engineering PO-35](https://amzn.to/2waC6YB) round out my hardware instruments. On the software side, I prefer to work with the [Korg iDS-10](https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_ids_10/), [Moog Animoog](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/animoog-0), [Moog Model D](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/minimoog-model-d-app), and the [Moog Filtatron](https://www.moogmusic.com/products/apps/filtatron). 

I have a variety of MIDI controllers that I like to use to control both hardware and software synthesizers. My current favorite is the [Arturia KeyStep](https://amzn.to/2vPbywQ) which also serves double-duty as an awesome step sequencer. The [Novation LaunchPad Mini](https://amzn.to/2Pi1pAJ) is great controller for creating more complex, sample-based pieces, and I wouldn't dream of ever letting go of my [ROLI Seaboard Block](https://amzn.to/2PgS1NS), [ROLI LightPad M](https://amzn.to/2PgRVG0), or [ROLI Live Block](https://amzn.to/2vSeLM1). 

Finally, all of this is connected via a thousand cables to a small [Mackie Mix8](https://amzn.to/2MRBVsA) mixer and a variety of effects (Reverb/Delay) pedals. Recordings are done inline with a [Roland R-07](https://amzn.to/2wa2eTy) portable studio recorder.

## Wish List

One can never have too many headphones or instruments. Sure, being restricted to a few items forces you to get creative. Still, there are times when you just want to sit down and bang out something epic using as many devices as you can. Plus, upgrading to better equipment is always nice. To that end, here is my top ten most wanted instruments.

1. [Arturia MatrixBrute](https://amzn.to/2Qhmi3v)
2. [Moog Subsequent 37](https://amzn.to/2QbMht5)
3. [Behringer Model D](https://amzn.to/2PikNfS)
