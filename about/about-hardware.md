## About - Hardware

I do all of my work on a 2018 Hex-Core MacBook Pro running the latest version of macOS. My home lab contains a [QNAP 563](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/model.php?II=194&event=2) NAS, Lenovo TS140 ThinkServer, Dell PowerEdge T100, an Apple Mac Mini server, and a six node [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) computing cluster. I'm currently using the ThinkServer and PowerEdge (which are running VMWare ESXi) to host multiple Linux and Windows virtual machines. My home network is made up of several Cisco gigabit switches, a beefy [EdgeRouter X](https://www.ubnt.com/edgemax/edgerouter-x/) router, several Eero mesh-points, and a single Eero 5Ghz router. So far we haven't had any issues switching over to mesh networking.
