## About - Geeky Stuff

I'm into comic books (along with my son. [Batman](http://www.dccomics.com/characters/batman) rules!), retro operating systems ([Amiga OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS), [BeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS), Commodore [KERNAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KERNAL), desktop role-playing games like [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/) and [Shadowrun](http://www.shadowrun.com), video games like [Diablo 3](us.battle.net/d3), [Doom](http://doom.com/en-us/), and [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com), and hacking on stuff like the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Some of my current hardware projects include making my old [Commodore 64C](http://www.mos6502.com/my-commodore-collection/commodore-64-series/commodore-64c/) talk to IBM's [Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/what-is-watson.html)  and building a replica of the Apollo Guidance Computer ([AGC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer)) used in NASA's [Apollo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program) program using a Raspberry Pi and 3D printing. Eventually, I would like to start my own geek/nerd podcast, create new Doom levels, finish some of the software projects that I've been working on, and ultimately take over the world.
