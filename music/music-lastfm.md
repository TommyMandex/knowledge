## Last.fm

What exactly is [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/home)? Well, it's basically a music website that makes use of a recommender system called "Autoscrobbler" to build a detailed profile of your musical tastes. It does this by tracking the details of every  song that you listen to, either from the web ([Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)), or via your computer and/or mobile device. Once collected, this data is then transferred ("scrobbled") to the Last.fm database. Your unique data is then collated and presented as detailed statistics on your user profile page.

## Last.fm Data - Weekly

Interested in my musical statistics? I'm a Last.fm subscriber, meaning I get more detailed stats that what free account holders might see. At the moment I am scrobbling via iTunes, Apple Music, Bandcamp, Deezer, and YouTube on my MacBook Pro, iPhone, iPad, and [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com) system. Check out my stats from [2018](https://www.last.fm/user/phmullins/listening-report/year/2018).
