## Headphone AMPS/DACS (Own)

- [Apogee Groove](https://amzn.to/2TwkJMT)
- [Hifiman EF2A](https://amzn.to/2TxrGx5) w/1960s Mullard 6AK5 tubes  
- [FiiO E10](https://amzn.to/2E79SEO)
- Schiit Fulla

I'm happy to say that I managed to score a matched pair of 1960s Mullard 6AK5 tubes on eBay. The stock Chinese tubes that came with my HIFIMAN EF2A headphone amp are terribly harsh on the old ears. There's no bass to speak of, a middling midrange, and bright, ear splitting highs. They're probably the worst sounding tubes that I've ever heard and they needed to be swapped out immediately. The British-made Mullards (especially the vintage variety) are widely considered to be the Cadillacs of the vacuum tube world. They produce a heavenly sound that contains plenty of tight, controlled bass, a smooth, focused midrange, and crystal clear, non-fatiguing highs. The only real drawbacks to these tubes are the associated shipping costs and actually being able to track down a matched pair. The United Kingdom seems to be the only country that still has a readily available supply of vintage Mullard tubes and, as you might imagine, the shipping costs to the United States are completely insane. Still, all things considered, the sublime sound that these tubes produce is well worth the overall monetary costs and the agonizingly long trip across the pond.

## Home Office

In my home office I have a set of [Paradigm 7SE](https://www.paradigm.com/products-hidden/model=performance-3se/page=specs) monitors and a Harmon-Kardon (HK3490) receiver. Yes, those are some big speakers, but damn they sound good! The 7SE is a 2 way rear ported system with a Vifa tweeter and Paradigms own 8" woofer with long lasting rubber surrounds.

## Home Theater

Sad to say but the home theater has fallen by the wayside of late. There was a time when I wouldn't watch a movie unless it was DTS encoded and made use of the 5.1 surround system that I had. These days? I installed a Bose Solo 5 sound bar above the Sony 4K set and haven't looked back. This means I have a few pieces of gear not being used. Most notably, the Rotel RSX-1055. 

- Receiver: Rotel RSX-1055 5.1 (6.1, 7.1 capable).
- Speakers: Polk Towers
- Sub Woofer: Polk PSW108 10‚Äù
- Television: 65" Sony XBR65X750D 4K HDR
- DVD/Blu-Ray: Sony UBP-X800
- Remote: Harmony Ultimate One
- Misc: Bose SOLO 5
