Music is one of the most important things in my life. Just ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you that I'm a music maniac. In fact, there's hardly ever a time that I don't have a pair of headphones on. I simply cannot imagine my life without music.

### Genres

My favorite musical genres are ambient, electronic, instrumental (Film Scores), Rock, and Blues. If interested, you can view my most listened to [artists](music-artists.md), songs and [albums](music-albums.md).
